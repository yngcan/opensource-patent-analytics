{"name":"Open Source Patent Analytics","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to the Open Source Patent Analytics Project.\r\n\r\nOur aim is to build a guide and resources for open source analysis of patent data. At the moment our plans cover the following. \r\n\r\n1. Getting Patent Data\r\n2. Tidying Patent Data\r\n3. Analysis\r\n4. Network Visualisation\r\n5. Dashboards\r\n6. Geographic Mapping\r\n\r\nWe are just getting started and the repository will fill up in the next few months. \r\n\r\n##Patent Datasets\r\n\r\nWe have created some patent datasets using WIPO Patent Landscape Reports and they are now publicly available for download and use [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B4piiKOCkRPDNThTWU1QQVYyRnM&usp=sharing) via Google Drive. \r\n\r\nYou can also access the datasets via the Github Repository but please use the Raw button on each page or you will simply receive the html page with the link on it.\r\n\r\nMore datasets will be loaded in due course. \r\n\r\n##Video Walkthroughs\r\n\r\nWe have started creating video walkthroughs on our [You Tube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwFhEASbKdm6WYoax73XsOw?spfreload=10) channel and will post more as we go.\r\n\r\n##Working with R\r\n\r\nWe are starting a series on using R with patent data. \r\n\r\n1. [Importing .csv files into R](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4piiKOCkRPDRkpxLVp4R2lWN3M/view?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n##Databases \r\n\r\nIf you have stumbled across this site looking for free sources of patent data here are some resources to get you started. \r\n\r\n* [espacenet](http://worldwide.espacenet.com/?locale=en_EP)\r\n* [patenscope](https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/search.jsf)\r\n* [free patents online](http://www.freepatentsonline.com/)\r\n* [patent lens](https://www.lens.org/lens/)\r\n* United States Patent and Trademark Office [Applications](http://appft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html) and [Grants](http://appft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html) Databases\r\n* China to 2012 via the Google & USPTO [collaboration](http://gpsn.uspto.gov/)\r\n* [Google Patents](www.google.com/patents)\r\n* [Google Bulk Download](http://www.google.com/googlebooks/uspto.html) for USPTO data\r\n\r\nThe excellent [Patent Information User Group](http://www.piug.org/) has plenty of other resources in its [Patent Databases List](http://wiki.piug.org/display/PIUG/Patent+Databases). \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, thanks for visiting, you are welcome to take a fork from the repository or check back later as we start to develop the resource.
