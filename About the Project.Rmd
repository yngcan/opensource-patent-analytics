## About the Project

1. This project provides resources and training in the use of open source patent analysis tools. 
2. Patent information is a valuable source of technical data on trends in scientific research and development and is increasingly used to inform policy debates and decisions. 
3. Millions of patent records are available online through patent databases such as [EPO espacenet](http://worldwide.espacenet.com/?locale=en_EP), [Patent Lens](http://www.lens.org/lens/) and [Patent Scope](https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/search.jsf).
3. The questions this project seeks to address are:
    + How to obtain patent data in a form that is useful for different types of analysis?
    + How to process, analyse and visualize patent data using only open source or free software?
    + How to promote confidence that the results of analysis are transparent and robust for informed decision-making? 

## Topics

The project is divided into six main topics:

1. Understanding Patent Data
2. Obtaining Patent Data
3. Processing Patent Data
4. Analysing Patent Data
5. Visualising Patent Data
6. Interactivity & Sharing Patent Data

Each of these topics will be accompanied by documentation, videos, code and resources to assist with patent analysis. 

We welcome your inputs to the project by contributing files, code or tips to the repository or the project Wiki.
